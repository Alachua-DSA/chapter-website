As a socialist organization, DSA stands with our LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters as they continue to struggle for liberation and equality. And we support our great local community organizations, like the Pride Community Center of North Central Florida.

Stop by our table, and we can talk about how liberal policies arenâ€™t doing enough to protect our Queer comrades, why socialist liberation and queer liberation are party of the same struggle, and how you can get involved.
