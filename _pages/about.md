## Build the Left 

We are the **Democratic Socialists of America.** We are socialiss living Gainesville, Alachua, Hawthorne, Micanopy, Waldo and throughout the county. 

We believe that Alachua County residents have the right to **affordable housing, a living wage,** and **accessible healthcare** from the cradle to the grave. 

Instead of investing taxpayer money into kidnapping our immigrant neighbors, our local and state government should focus on **real issues** affecting their citizens.
